1. Given a character array in the following statement,
	char str1[] = “This is Exercise 1.”;
2. Write a program to measure the length of a string by evaluating the elements in a
character array one by one until you reach the null character. To prove you get the
right result, you can use the strlen() function to measure the same string again.
3. Rewrite the program in Listing 13.4. This time, convert all uppercase characters to
their lowercase counterparts.
4. Write a program that uses the scanf() function to read in two integers entered by
the user, adds the two integers, and then prints out the sum on the screen.
